# basic_voting-system
This project is an online voting system that allows users to securely and efficiently cast their votes for a candidate of their choice. The system includes three main steps:
ID Verification: Users enter their ID number to verify their identity.
Voting Process: Verified users can view candidate avatars and cast their vote for one candidate.
Certificate Generation: After voting, users receive a certificate acknowledging their participation and indicating the candidate they voted for.

Real-Time Application Benefits:
Convenience: Voters can participate in elections from anywhere with internet access, eliminating the need to travel to polling stations.

Accessibility: The system is user-friendly and accessible, making it easier for people with disabilities or those in remote areas to vote.

Efficiency: The online voting system streamlines the voting process, reducing wait times and manual errors associated with traditional voting methods.

Security: ID verification ensures that only eligible voters can participate, preventing unauthorized voting.

Transparency: The system can be designed to provide real-time voting updates and results, enhancing the transparency of the election process.

Environmental Impact: By reducing the need for paper ballots and physical polling stations, the online voting system contributes to environmental sustainability.
